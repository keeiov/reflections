What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository is just starting an empty git file where your file history and commits will be saved.  You need to do it to track changes in your files.

I actually don't have a definition of a working directory.  I'm assuming that it is the local file on my computer that I am trying to put into a git repository.  The staging area is the temporary space between the working directory and the repository.I don't fully understand the staging area though because I ended up deleting a file by trying to remove it from that space before it was commited.  That seems like it should not be possible, and is a serious vulnerability in my view.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? You can stage everything at once, but commit each of those in a logical way, one by one.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help? Branches would allow you to go off in a different direction without affecting the main work.
