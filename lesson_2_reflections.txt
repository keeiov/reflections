What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository is just starting an empty git file where your file history and commits will be saved.  You need to do it to track changes in your files.

I actually don't have a definition of a working directory.  I'm assuming that it is the local file on my computer that I am trying to put into a git repository.  The staging area is the temporary space between the working directory and the repository.I don't fully understand the staging area though because I ended up deleting a file by trying to remove it from that space before it was commited.  That seems like it should not be possible, and is a serious vulnerability in my view.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? You can stage everything at once, but commit each of those in a logical way, one by one.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help? Branches would allow you to go off in a different direction without affecting the main work.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? It allows you to show and see the relationships between branches and their lineage.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do? All of the changes in each branch were combined into one file and made into the main master branch.  the diagram represents the lineage of each branch to show where they came from.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually? Git merges pretty well automatically, but not when there are changes made to a file in the same code.  That is when you need to look at it to make sure which change is the one to keep.  It would be laborious to merge everything manually, however, and vulnerable to missing something.  So a combination is probably best.
