When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository in order to make it easier to collaborate with another person.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might want to check the changes before you commit to them.  And you might want to keep the remote repository untouched in case you mess something up while you are testing something out locally.
